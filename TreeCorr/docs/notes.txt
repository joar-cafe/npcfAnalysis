This file just contains some notes to myself about various things.

Checklist for making a new release:

For new major or minor releases:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Update the wiki pages to incorporate any changes as needed.
- Update any docs that might need updating.
- git checkout -b releases/M.m
- git push -u origin releases/M.m

For all releases:

- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value in _version.py
- Update CHANGELOG if necessary.
- pip install .  (make sure this is current)
- In docs directory, run update_docs
- Commit new docs in releases/M.m branch as single commit.
- On GitHub page, go to Code - Tags - Releases
    (https://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/releases)
- Draft a new release
    - Set tag version vM.m.r
    - Set target releases/M.m
    - Set title Version M.m.r
    - For text, link to CHANGELOG and full docs
    - Publish Release
- Check the twine upload that it is running.
- When done, check pip install treecorr locally.

For major or minor releases:

- Back in main, update version number to M.(m+1) (i.e. no .r)
- Add tagged CHANGELOG blob to the history page in the docs.
- Clear out CHANGELOG.rst
- Change github home page to point to releases/M.m
- Also change the Pages to point to releases/M.m
